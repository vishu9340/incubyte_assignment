# incubyte_assignment
Description:
First I have created a text file in my system as described in the assignment pdf file.
Then I read the file into a dataframe and I group them based on country which creates seperate sections for each country.
Then using the dictionary I made the key as country name and value as dataframe which contains the data of patients for that country.
Using this I created different dataframes for different countries.
